## Repository Structure
```
Action Grammars
+- workspace.ipynb: Main workspace notebook - Execute for replication
```

## How to use this code
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/RobertTLange/Bio-Plausible-DeepLearning && cd Bio-Plausible-DeepLearning
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
```
virtualenv -p python BPDL
```
Activate the env (the following command works on Linux, other operating systems might differ):
```
source BPDL/bin/activate
```
3. Install all dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the main notebook:
```
jupyter notebook workspace.ipynb
```
